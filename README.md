## **üìå Overview**

[TITAN](https://titansoftwork.net)'s Spoofer is a security utility designed to prevent account bans while using exploits on **Roblox for Windows/Web**.  

With Roblox integrating a ban API and combining Hyperion‚Äôs (Byfron) detection mechanisms, exploit developers have begun offering paid spoofers. I've decided to give the community a **free, open-source** solution.  

### **How It Works**
The spoofer anonymizes system identifiers before and after an exploit session, effectively resetting your system‚Äôs digital footprint. This prevents Roblox from associating your device with previous accounts played on.

---

## **üíé Features**
- **Hyperion HWID Bypass** ‚Äì Spoofs all relevant hardware identifiers monitored by Hyperion.  
- **Automated Roblox Reinstallation** ‚Äì Uses **Bloxstrap** for reinstallation, with **RobloxInstaller** as a fallback.  
- **Full Hardware Unban** ‚Äì Restores access if you are HWID-banned by Hyperion.  
- **Antiban Guide** ‚Äì Includes a comprehensive guide on avoiding bans and recovering accounts, available in the **[TITAN Discord](https://titansoftwork.net)**.  

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
- This tool **does not** unban **Roblox accounts** that have been banned **onsite** (i.e., account-level bans managed server-side).  
- This does not apply to **individual game bans**, as those are enforced by specific game developers.
